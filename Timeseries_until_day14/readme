**#Time Series Analysis: ROC-AUC Comparison Across Models**
This repository presents a time series analysis of predictive models, comparing their ROC-AUC performance over time across train, test, and validation sets. We explore two machine learning models—Random Forest and Logistic Regression—and evaluate their performance as more data points (days) are added to the training.
